        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Working out daily with dedication , controlling your diet , curbing your cravings is no easy task. It requires alot of hard work, dedication and perseverance. No motivation can put you on the path of healthy life unless it's come from within. No YouTube video, no modelâ€™s pic or a girl can make you workout in gym day in and day out. It's your internal motivation which keeps you on this hard path. Do you really think that someone would give up delicious pizza , awesome burgers, rich food , beers, lazying in bed to impress some random people? No. You do it for yourself , not for others. And certainly not for fb, Instagram or Snapchat people. It's just a positive externality of keeping yourself fit. <br>

            So let's analyze why the gyms have propped up today. Certainly our forefathers didn't went to such places and still remained fit. The reason is change in our lifestyle. Human body was evolved to walk , run tens of kilometre daily, do physical labour, eat natural food which our forefathers did as hunters, gatheres and farmers. They ate organic and fresh food. And most importantly human body is evolved to store fat which acts as energy source in times of scarcity just like the hump of camel. Their physical activity and nutrition was enough to keep them fit. They rarely had food in abundance to make them fat.
